Flower Classification Project
Flower classification with Convolutional Neural Networks,it presents a classification system for flower images by using Deep CNN with 90% accuracy. 
import different models:
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Convolution2D
from keras.layers import MaxPooling2D
from keras.layers import Flatten
from keras.layers import Dense
# Step 1 - Convolution
# Step 2 - Pooling
# Adding a second convolutional layer
# Step 3 - Flattening
# Step 4 - Full connection
# Compiling the CNN
# Part 2 - Fitting the CNN to the images
