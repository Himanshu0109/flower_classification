Flower Classification Project
Flower classification with Convolutional Neural Networks,it presents a classification system for flower images by using Deep CNN with 90% accuracy. 
Data acquisition.
We will use public flowers dataset which stored on kaggle. It contains five varieties of flowers: daisy,dandelion,rose, sunflower,tulip
Architecture.
Main idea is to tune pre-trained model with the library to get best possible result.
# Step 1 - Convolution
# Step 2 - Pooling
# Adding a second convolutional layer
# Step 3 - Flattening
# Step 4 - Full connection
# Compiling the CNN
# Part 2 - Fitting the CNN to the images
